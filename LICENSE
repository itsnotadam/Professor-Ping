# ACADEMIC RESEARCH LICENSE

## SECTION 1: THE OBVIOUS PART
This is research software. Don't do illegal things with it. If you need a 10-page document to tell you not to break the law, you probably shouldn't be using this software.

## SECTION 2: EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION
**Permitted Uses:** 
- Learning how botnets work (so you can defend against them)
- Academic research (papers that nobody will read)
- Authorized testing (with more paperwork than actual testing)

**Prohibited Uses:**
- Everything that's already illegal in your jurisdiction
- Annoying your ISP with excessive traffic
- Testing on systems that aren't yours (unless you enjoy legal letters)

## SECTION 3: LEGAL STUFF
We both know this license is about as enforceable as a EULA for a $2 app. But it looks official, and that's what matters for GitHub's automated systems.

## SECTION 4: REAL TALK
If you're using this for actual research: cool, be safe, get permission.
If you're using this for anything else: we never had this conversation.

## SECTION 5: FINAL DISCLAIMER
The authors categorically deny any knowledge of how this software might be used in the wild. Any resemblance to actual working malware is purely coincidental and definitely not intentional.
